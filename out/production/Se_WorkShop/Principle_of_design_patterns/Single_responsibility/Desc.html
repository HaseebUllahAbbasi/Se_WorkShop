<p>coupling and the cohesion (principle)  how much the two class are connected, the strength of relationship</p>
<p>
    should  be low coupling. , low small dependencies between classes and the methods

    cohesion : what a class can do
    <br>

    low: unfocused , what it should do
    <br>
    high : methods relating to the intention  of the class
