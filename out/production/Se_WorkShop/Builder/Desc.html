<h1>
    why to use the builer pattern
</h1>
<p>
    These are three major:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        too many argument to pass  client side to factory class
        .. error prone
    </li>
    <li>
        if the object si heavy and its creation is complex
    </li>
    <h2>
        Summary :
    </h2>
    <p>
        use it when the algo for creating complex object should be independent of the parts that make yp the object and the how they are assembled
    </p>
    <p>
        avoid this when we have mutable object
    </p>



</ul>
