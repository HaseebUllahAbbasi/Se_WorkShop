    Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes. Abstract Factory defines an interface for creating all distinct products ,<br>
    but leaves the actual product creation to concrete factory classes.
</p>

<p>Provide the interface : creating families of related or dependent objets without specifying their concrete classes </p>
<p>
    super factory that create other factory, factory of factories
</p>
<p>
    create of objects via abstraction
</p>
<p>
provide the encapsulation mechanism to factories : factory method is the subset o this pattern
</p>
<br>
<br>

<p>
    but there is often a concrete class to implemented for each family
</p>


<h3>
    when to use this:
</h3>
<p>
    when a system should be independent, how the products are created and composed and represented
</p>
<p>
    when we deal with multiple fact
</p>
<p>
    when the (problem) domain has different families of objects present and each family used under different circumstances
</p>

<p>
    when a family of related objects designed to used together

</p>
<p>
    when you provide class lib and reveal their interfaces not their implementations
</p>
