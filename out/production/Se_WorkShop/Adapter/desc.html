<ul>
    <li>adapter design pattern converts the interface  into another interface : </li>
    <li>
        works ad bridge between two incompatible interfaces : Adapter does the conversion

    </li>
    <li>
        also known as wrapper : let classes work together ,
    </li>
    <li>combines the capability of the two interfaces  </li>
    <li>
        acts as decouple  the client from the implemented interface
        <p>encapsulates the futures change</p>
        <p>
            client does not need to be modified each time it needs to operate against a different interface : losing coupling
        </p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>use the composition to wrap , binds the client to interface </p>
    </li>
